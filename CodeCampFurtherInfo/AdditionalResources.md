# Additional Resources

### Jupyter Resources
* [Jupyter Official Documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation)
* [Jupyter Notebooks Cheatsheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jupyter_Notebook_CheatSheet_Edureka.pdf)
* [Your First Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) - also covers a bit of pandas data wrangling and matplotlib plotting
* [Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Markdown Resources
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from Github
* [Original Markdown Syntax Specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax/) from John Gruber
* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet) from Nesta CMS

### Fundamental Python Coding Concepts
* [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage)
* [Overview of data types in Python](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)
* [Guide to native Python data structures](https://realpython.com/python-data-structures/)
* [Strings and character data in Python](https://realpython.com/python-strings/)
* [Definitive Iteration ('for' loops)](https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/#a-survey-of-definite-iteration-in-programming)
* [Conditional Flow control ('if' statements)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
* [Defining your own Python function](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)
* [Python for Earth Data Analytics](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/) - this set of web resources is excellent and directly applicable to geoscience; a great resource to begin to get more in-depth into computer programming for earth sciences.

### Different Open Data Formats
* [European Data Portal e-learning programme](https://data.europa.eu/elearning/en/#/id/co-01) - Module 9 provides a comprehensive introduction to open data formats. Other modules cover useful related topics such as how to make your data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible), and how to understand different data licenses.
* [Introduction to using CSV in Python](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/ch01data/062csv.html) - from the Alan Turing Institute, who do a lot of good stuff with Python
* [Quick intro to structured data files in Python](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/ch01data/064JsonYamlXML.html) - again from ATI, covers JSON (Java Script Object Notation), XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). JSON is *'the data file of the web'*, so well worth learning about as it's very widely used in many different fields
* [Using tabular data in earth science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/file-formats/use-text-files/use-tabular-data/)
* [Massive reference list of GIS file formats and extensions](https://gisgeography.com/gis-formats/#Geographic_Database_File_Formats)

### Scientific Computing: NumPy and Matplotlib
* [Introduction to NumPy from the Alan Turing Institute](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/ch01data/082NumPy.html) - explicit comparisons between NumPy arrays and Python lists, handy for Matlab users to get their heads around Python data structures
* [Introduction to Matplotlib from the Alan Turing Institute](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/ch01data/072plotting.html) - very basic intro to scientific plotting
* [Comprehensive guide to Matplotlib](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/) - very in-depth and detailed
* [Very basic NumPy](https://realpython.com/numpy-tutorial/) - from realpython.com. You may have noticed I quite like their material!
* [Official NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
* [Matplotlib homepage](https://matplotlib.org/) - very good tutorials and documentation here

### Pandas
There are absolutely masses of webpages dedicated to using Pandas specifically. I would say it's become the most pervasive trend in all data science in recent years. Here is just a sample of stuff to get you started.
* [10 minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) - from the official Pandas documentation
* [Exploring a dataset with Pandas](https://realpython.com/pandas-python-explore-dataset/) - covers most stuff to do with Pandas: data indexing, stats, plotting etc
* [Plot with Pandas](https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/) - covers all the types of plots included within Pandas
* [More advanced Pandas tricks](https://realpython.com/python-pandas-tricks/) - some stuff worth implementing once you've mastered the basics
